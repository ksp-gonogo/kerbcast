// KSPAddon entry point. Hooks into the Flight scene, scans the active
// vessel for Hullcam VDS parts, and pumps an AsyncGPUReadback per camera
// each LateUpdate. Each KerbcastCamera owns its own MmapFrameRing keyed
// by KSP's stable Part.flightID; the Rust sidecar discovers rings by
// globbing the kerbcast/ subdirectory under XDG_RUNTIME_DIR.
//
// Lifecycle:
//   - Awake:    spawn AsyncReadbackUpdater (KSP loads mod DLLs after
//               [RuntimeInitializeOnLoadMethod] would fire, so the
//               vendored yangrc updater never auto-attaches).
//               Ensure the rings directory exists, then notify the
//               session-persistent KerbcastSidecarHost (which spawns the
//               sidecar on the FIRST flight of the session and keeps it
//               running across scene changes).
//               Subscribe GameEvents.onPartDestroyed to detect Hullcam
//               part destruction mid-flight.
//   - GameEvents.onVesselChange: rebuild the camera list (which
//               creates/destroys the matching ring files).
//   - GameEvents.onPartDestroyed: write lifecycle:"destroyed" tombstone
//               to the camera's info.json, close the ring, then leave
//               info.json for the sidecar to clean up. Once
//               onGameSceneLoadRequested has fired the scene is unloading,
//               so part destructions become normal teardowns instead.
//   - GameEvents.onVesselCrewWasModified: crew-scoped rescan (board /
//               transfer / EVA / re-seat within the same vessel). Clean-
//               removes vacated kerbal cams (Dispose, not a tombstone)
//               and adds newly-seated ones via CrewProvider only.
//   - LateUpdate: defensive null-check sweep before the main Refresh()
//               loop catches cameras whose part/vessel went null without
//               a matching onPartDestroyed event (mod interactions, etc).
//               Also refreshes each tracked camera.
//   - OnDestroy: unsubscribe onPartDestroyed, tear down cameras (each
//               disposes its own ring + deletes its files). The sidecar
//               is NOT stopped: it belongs to KerbcastSidecarHost and
//               survives scene changes (the camera-ring removals are all
//               it observes). It dies on game exit or via the heartbeat
//               orphan watch.
