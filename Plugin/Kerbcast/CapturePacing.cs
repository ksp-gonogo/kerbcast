// CapturePacing — how often a subscribed camera is allowed to capture.
//
// Two rates are in play. The PRIMARY rate is what a camera someone is actually
// watching gets. The BACKGROUND rate (the "background capture") is what a camera keeps ticking
// over at when it is still subscribed but nothing is displaying it at size, so
// that switching to it promotes an already-flowing stream instead of
// cold-starting from black.
//
// Pacing is expressed as ELIGIBILITY rather than as a capture budget, and that
// choice is load-bearing. EVERY camera, primary included, joins a tick's capture
// set only once its own interval has elapsed, so each consumes stagger permits
// in proportion to its rate: a 1fps background camera among 30fps primaries
// takes about 1/30th of the slots. Since background capture varies rate and
// never resolution, a background capture costs exactly what a primary capture
// costs, so the existing per-camera cost model stays honest with no
// special-casing anywhere.
//
// The primary rate is paced here too because the stagger budget cannot cap it:
// permits are whole numbers shared over the eligible cameras, so the rate that
// falls out is budget/count x gameFps, which overshoots the cap by more and more
// as the set gets smaller. Measured on the Deck at 53fps: 5 cameras ran 31.8fps,
// 4 plus one in background capture ran 39.5fps, one alone ran the full 53fps.
//
// Deliberately depends ONLY on System.* (no UnityEngine) so a standalone dotnet
// test project can compile + run this file with no KSP assemblies — same
// approach as ControlBlock.cs and ShedController.cs.
