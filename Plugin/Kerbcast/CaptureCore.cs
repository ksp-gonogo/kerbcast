/* Reusable frame-capture tail shared by every kerbcast camera type.

   Owns the pooled capture/readback RenderTexture pair, the in-flight
   readback bookkeeping, the ReadbackTargetTracker and the mmap ring
   write. A camera renders its own layer stack into CaptureRt, then hands
   the tail here: Publish blits CaptureRt -> ReadbackRt (via the caller's
   filter/nightvision/plain blit), applies the vertical-flip correction,
   and issues one AsyncGPUReadback with the one-in-flight invariant; Drain
   copies a completed readback straight into the ring.

   Deck-critical details preserved verbatim from KerbcastCamera: the
   readback RT is depth=0 (clean GL_TEXTURE_2D handle on Mesa), the flip
   gate is SystemInfo.graphicsUVStartsAtTop, and the drain takes the
   zero-copy TryGetRawPtr path before the GetData fallback. */
