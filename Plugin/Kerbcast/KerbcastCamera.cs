/* Per-Hullcam VDS tracking. Owns Unity Cameras (near / scaled / galaxy,
   plus a spike far-local layer) parented to the part's transform, an
   AsyncGPUReadback request in flight at most, and writes RGBA frames
   into a per-camera mmap ring on each completed readback.

   Layered camera shape matches KSP's flight camera: galaxy renders skybox
   + distant celestials, scaled renders planet terrain/atmosphere at scale,
   far (spike) renders the mid-range terrain band between the near clip and
   the scaled-space handoff, near renders close parts + atmosphere effects.
   All layers target the same RenderTexture so one readback captures the
   composite.

   Render path: all cameras are permanently disabled (enabled=false) so
   Unity's auto-render never fires them. Instead, Refresh() calls
   camera.Render() explicitly each frame in galaxy -> scaled -> far -> near
   order. */
// This prevents KSP's deferred "Composite Shadows" CommandBuffer from
// running against the wrong framebuffer when our cameras render — that
// buffer would otherwise null out sun diffuse on planet surfaces, leaving
// them black while the atmospheric limb (a separate render path) stayed
// bright. ScaledSunLightHelper strips and restores the buffer around the
// Scaled layer's Render() call. Per-layer shedding is now expressed as
// "skip camera.Render() this tick" rather than toggling enabled.
//
// Atmospheric FX: kerbcast's own pluggable plasma overlay (the stock FXCamera
// effect couldn't be faithfully reproduced offscreen — see
// atmospheric_fx_parked.md). A per-camera FxHost owns a set of IAtmoFxEffect
// layers (core sheath, bowshock, trail, embers). The core effect attaches a
// CommandBuffer to _nearCam at AfterForwardAlpha that re-draws the vessel's
// part renderers with our additive plasma material — inside the near render, so
// it composites against the near depth (correct occlusion). See Fx/.
