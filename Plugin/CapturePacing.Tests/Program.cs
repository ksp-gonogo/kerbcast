// Unit tests for CapturePacing: the per-camera capture-rate decisions, both the
// primary rate and the reduced background-capture rate.
//
// What these guard, in order of importance:
//
// 1. THE RATE CAP. No camera captures faster than MaxCaptureFps, whatever the
//    game fps is and whatever the other cameras are doing. Pacing is where that
//    cap lives, because the stagger budget provably cannot hold it: permits are
//    whole numbers shared over the eligible cameras, so the rate it yields
//    (budget/count x gameFps) overshoots by more and more as the set shrinks.
//    Section 10 measures the achieved rate through the whole per-tick loop.
// 2. Background capture keeps a subscribed-but-undisplayed camera ticking over
//    slowly so switching to it promotes an already-flowing stream instead of
//    cold-starting from black, and it draws stagger permits in proportion to its
//    rate rather than competing head-on with the feed being watched.
//
// Exit code 0 = pass, 1 = fail.
