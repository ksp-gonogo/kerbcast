//! HTTP signalling endpoint. Two endpoints + the bundled web UI:
//!
//! - `GET /cameras` returns a JSON list of currently-attached cameras
//!   (with `part_title`, `vessel_name`, etc); the browser fetches this
//!   to populate its picker before opening a peer connection.
//! - `POST /offer` takes `{ sdp, cameras: [flight_id, ...] }`, creates a
//!   `KerbcastPeer` with one video track per selected camera AND a
//!   "kerbcast-control" data channel, answers the SDP, and returns the
//!   answer. Unknown camera IDs are dropped with a warning rather than
//!   failing the whole request.
//! - `GET /` serves the bundled kerbcast web UI (web/dist/index.html,
//!   embedded at compile time via include_str!).
//! - `GET /assets/mediabunny.min.mjs` serves the Mediabunny remux-trim
//!   package the web page's grouped-recording flow dynamic-imports (also
//!   embedded at compile time, from web/dist/assets/mediabunny.min.mjs --
//!   see web/vite.config.ts's copyMediabunnyAsset step). Kept out of
//!   index.html's own single-file bundle so a page load that never touches
//!   grouped recording never pays for it; served locally so the trim works
//!   offline/LAN with no CDN.
//!
//! Per-camera operational state (layer mask, render size, future zoom)
//! is no longer exposed over HTTP — it's owned by the data channel
//! protocol in `crate::protocol`. The protocol is bidirectional so the
//! sidecar can also push state changes back (adaptive shed events,
//! vessel changes) without the client polling.
