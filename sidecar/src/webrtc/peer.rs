//! WebRTC peer for the kerbcast sidecar. One `KerbcastPeer` per browser
//! connection; each carries one H.264 video track per camera the browser
//! subscribed to AND a "kerbcast-control" data channel for bidirectional
//! protocol messages (see `crate::protocol`). webrtc-rs handles
//! ICE/DTLS/SRTP/RTP packetisation internally.
//!
//! Track lifecycle: the peer owns Arcs to its tracks for the duration of
//! its RTCPeerConnection. Each camera's registry entry holds a Weak ref
//! to the same track + a subscriber count. When the peer is dropped,
//! the Arcs go with it; the camera-side consume loop notices the dead
//! Weaks on its next tick and decrements its subscriber count.
//!
//! Data channel: created by the browser side (the offer SDP includes a
//! datachannel m-section). When it opens, the handler dispatches
//! incoming `ClientMessage` JSON; the server replies / pushes
//! `ServerMessage` JSON back. The plugin reads the mutated control
//! state via its periodic `*.control.json` poll, so layer/render-size
//! changes propagate within ~1s of the data-channel write.
