//! WebRTC data-channel protocol between the sidecar and a streaming
//! client (browser / gonogo / future Kotlin or Swift consumer).
//!
//! Wire format: JSON-per-message over an `RTCDataChannel` opened by the
//! browser *after* the SDP exchange and track negotiation are complete.
//! The data channel exists for per-camera operational state — layer
//! masks, render-size, keyframe requests, future zoom — that the
//! receiving client wants to influence in real time without
//! renegotiating SDP.
//!
//! Single source of truth: this module's types carry `#[typeshare]`
//! annotations. The `typeshare` CLI reads them and emits TypeScript
//! (and Kotlin / Swift / Scala / Go when those consumers materialise)
//! into `client-sdk/`. The CI workflow runs typeshare on every push to
//! `sidecar/src/protocol/**` and publishes the resulting npm package as
//! `@kerbcast/protocol`.
//!
//! All types use camelCase JSON keys to match TypeScript convention.
//! Enums use adjacent tagging (`tag = "type", content = "content"`)
//! because that's the discriminator form `typeshare` can faithfully
//! mirror in TypeScript:
//!
//!   { "type": "set-layers", "content": { "flightId": 123, "layers": [...] } }
//!
//! Unit variants (e.g. `Hello`) emit just `{ "type": "hello" }`.
