//! Per-camera state owned by the sidecar.
//!
//! The plugin (writer side) creates one ring file per Hullcam VDS part,
//! keyed by KSP's stable `Part.flightID`. The sidecar (reader side) globs
//! `<shm_dir>/*.ring`, parses the filename's stem as a u32 flight ID, and
//! maintains a registry of `CameraState` keyed by that ID.
//!
//! Each `CameraState` owns one mmap ring, one lazy-initialised
//! `EncoderBackend` (created on first frame so it sees the actual ring
//! dimensions), and a list of `TrackLocalStaticSample` weak refs — one per
//! peer-track subscribed to this camera. The consume loop iterates the
//! registry once per tick, encodes only cameras with `subscribers > 0`,
//! and fans the resulting NALs out to every alive track.
